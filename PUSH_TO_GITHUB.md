# Push Dashboard to GitHub

## Quick Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository:
- **Repository name**: `limitless-dashboard`
- **Description**: `Real-time web dashboard for monitoring Limitless Trading Bot performance`
- **Visibility**: Public (or Private if you prefer)
- **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)

### 2. Push Code

Once created, run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/byteblocks/limitless-dashboard

# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME if needed)
git remote add origin https://github.com/0xfarme/limitless-dashboard.git

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify

Visit: https://github.com/0xfarme/limitless-dashboard

You should see:
- All source files
- README.md with setup instructions
- SETUP.md with deployment guide

---

## Alternative: Use Existing Bot Repo

If you want to keep everything in one repo:

```bash
cd /Users/byteblocks/limitless-dashboard

# Add as remote to bot repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/0xfarme/limitless-bot.git

# Push to a separate branch
git checkout -b dashboard
git push -u origin dashboard
```

Then the dashboard will be in the `dashboard` branch of your bot repo.

## Need Help?

If you don't have access to create repos in the `0xfarme` organization, you can:

1. Create in your personal account:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/limitless-dashboard.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. Then transfer to organization later via GitHub Settings
